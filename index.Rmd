### About Me

I am an associate professor in the Department of Demography at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

I am also the current co-editor of Population Research and Policy Review

My research focuses primarily on spatial and statistical demography. Substantively, I am interested in human health disparities, food security, historical demography and demography of anthropological populations.

My teaching focuses on the use and application of advanced statistical techniques including hierarchical modeling, hazard modeling, multivariate methods and spatial statistics in human population analysis.

I contribute regularly to the Rpubs site, and you can find lots of R examples for demographic analysis [here](https://rpubs.com/corey_sparks)
